                                        As you get older you may need help dealing with the day to day running of your affairs. You can appoint someone as your attorney to assist you.
                                        There are two types of Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)­­ - a Personal Welfare LPA and a Property and Affairs LPA. These do the following:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Health &amp; Welfare LPA: This authorises your attorney to make decisions about your personal welfare which includes healthcare and medical treatment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Property &amp; Finances LPA: This authorises your attorney to act in relation to your property, investments and financial affairs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We are experienced in preparing LPAs and we are happy to visit clients at home or in hospital if required.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We will also act as or for attorneys to assist in administering peoples affairs.</p>
